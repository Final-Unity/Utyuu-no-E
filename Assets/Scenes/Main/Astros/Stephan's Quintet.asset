  description: Located about 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus,
    the Stephan Quintuple was the first galaxy cluster to be discovered. Four of
    the five galaxies in the cluster are trapped in repeated "cosmic dances" close
    to each other.

  guidance: I searched for the cat with my eyes. I searched for a long, long time
    and found nothing. Sometimes I would dream of colorful clouds, but I never knew
    what those were, so maybe my cat was in the clouds. One day I dreamed of a blue
    eye. As I closed my eyes, he opened it toward me. He said he was senile to see
    me for 650 light years.
  banner: "He said that cat is everywhere, and I said that at least it's not with
    me. He sighed and said, \"Naturally, cat is not in dreams. Open your eyes and
    look hard into nothing, the emptiness is actually the reality, and the void is
    actually the truth.\r"
