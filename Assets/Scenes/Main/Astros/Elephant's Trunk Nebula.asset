  description: "Located within the massive free gas region IC 1396 in the constellation
    Cepheus, an area of high concentration of interstellar matter about 2,400 light-years
    from Earth. The nebula, known as IC 1396A, appears as a dark, dense ball. It
    is known colloquially as the Elephantin tube Nebula because it is a dark patch
    with bright, sinuous edges at visible wavelengths.\r"
