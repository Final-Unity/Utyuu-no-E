  description: "The Southern Ring Nebula, or octa nebula, is a giant ball of gas
    and dust nearly half a light year across, illuminated by a decaying star about
    2,000 light-years away from Earth. As stars age, they change the way they produce
    energy and repel their outer layers. The constellation is called the planetary
    Nebula, but it has nothing to do with planets. That was the result of the early
    telescope watchers' lack of resolution, and hence the misnomer of words. The
    Webb telescope is trying to see how stars are born, but it also wants to see
    how stars die.\r"
