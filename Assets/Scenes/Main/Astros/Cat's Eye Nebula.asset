  description: "The\_Cat's Eye Nebula (also known as\_NGC 6543 and\_Caldwell\_6 )
    is a\_planetary nebula in the northern constellation of\_Draco, discovered by\_William
    Herschel\_on February 15, 1786. It was the first planetary nebula whose\_spectrum\_was
    investigated by the English\_amateur astronomer\_William Huggins, demonstrating
    that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. Structurally,
    the object has had high-resolution images by the\_Hubble Space Telescope\_revealing
    knots, jets, bubbles and complex arcs, being illuminated by the central hot\_planetary
    nebula\_nucleus (PNN).\r"
