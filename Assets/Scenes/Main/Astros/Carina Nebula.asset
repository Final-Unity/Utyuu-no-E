  description: "Carina is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky, located
    about 7,600 light-years from Earth. Carina is a \"stellar nursery,\" a huge cloud
    of gas and dust where new stars can be born. But in this Webb telescope image,
    we don't see much of the stars, just gas and dust. Astronomers call this a cosmic
    reef, a kind of dividing line with dust at the bottom and gas at the top.\r"
