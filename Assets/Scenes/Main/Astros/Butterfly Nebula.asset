    69) is a\_bipolar\_planetary nebula\_in the constellation\_Scorpius. The structure
    in the nebula is among the most complex ever observed in planetary nebulae. The
    spectrum of NGC 6302 shows that its central\_star\_is one of the hottest stars
    known, with a surface temperature in excess of 250,000 degrees Celsius, implying
    that the star from which it formed must have been very large.\r"
