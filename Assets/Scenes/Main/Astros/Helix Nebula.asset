  description: "The blue pupil and white eye ball are surrounded by flesh-colored
    eyelids, similar to the eye, but the eye of God is actually so vast that it takes
    five to six years for the light to travel from one side to the other.  The object
    is actually a shell of gas and dust blown from a dim star in the central constellation
    of Aquarius.\r"

  guidance: "\"So, I began my search again, seeking, searching in the endless ocean
    \_\nThis time, I found it again, the cat \_\nIn the cosmic ballroom, four clusters
    of stars disperse and converge, performing a graceful cosmic dance for 80 million
    years\"\r"
  banner: "\"I arrived at the ballroom of my dreams, feeling the grace and rhythm
    of a quintet \_\nIt is the breath of the universe, the pulse of the planets\"\r"
